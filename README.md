# How it works

The application is connected to a node backend. When the app loads, it pull the todos data from the server.

Every time a user performs an action (add, check, delete), it is send to the server and the data gets updated.

The view gets updated as well giving the feel of live editing.

# Motivation

This is a school project, with the purpose of practicing **angular http requests** and **sass styling**.
